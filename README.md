How to use (old):
1. Close exitlag
2. Create an Exitlag account
3. Run vaccine.exe as administrator, choose [2] and restart
5. After restart, run vaccine.exe again and choose [1], open Exitlag, login and restart
6. Enjoy!

How to use (new):
explore it yourself :) (im too lazy to write it)

now working at EAC, FaceIT,... (run spoofer, login ur new account, use for 2-3 mins then restart and enjoy)

if you have any bug, contact me via Discord: merkii272#8047 (you can open issue, i might not reply DM sometimes)

Use at your own risk! Im not responsible to your action (or ban?) (just reboot after spoof, u will be free to use exitlag without triggering AC)
